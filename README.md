Navigate in the different `chX` directory and look at the examples provided and
do the exercises when applicable.
Each directory has its own README.md with specific directions.

Note:
The exercises have been tested with the open source repository of LLVM at the
Git hash 0fc4e3052454 from July 14th 2024.

Some of the exercises interact directly with the LLVM C++ API.
This API has no stability guarantee therefore it is possible that newer or older
version of LLVM will not work with these exercises.
